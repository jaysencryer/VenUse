## Project Overview

What is this, and why did I write it?

---
## Distinctiveness and Complexity

What does it do, how does it differ from the other stuff.

## Challenges and Future Development

What doesn't work very well, and where I may take this

## Project File Structure

### VenUse/

Python files, **apps.py** and **admin.py** not listed as they are generated by django and only changed minimally.

- ``api.py``
     
     Contains api endpoints which return JsonResponses to database queries.  These are leveraged by the JavaScript frontend.
     - ``/get_venue/<venue_id>`` - retrieves **Venue** information including Rooms, Bookings and Address.
     - ``/add_room`` - adds a new room to a **Venue**
     - ``/add_venue`` - adds a **Venue** this works as both a json endpoint, and a http POST.
     - ``/get_availability/<room_id>`` - retrieves the **Availability** of a **Room**
     - ``/make_booking`` - makes a booking for requested slots in a room on a given date.
     - ``/get_bookings/<room_id>`` - retrieves all **Bookings** from today forward for a given **Room**
     - ``/get_bookings/<venue_id>`` - mapped to ``get_venue_bookings`` - retrieves all **Bookings** from today forward for a given **Venue** 
     - ``/get_bookings/<username>`` - mapped to ``get_user_bookings`` - retrieves all **Bookings** from today forward for a given **User**
     - ``/post_address/<venue_id>`` - adds an **Address** to a **Venue** if it doesn't already have one.

- ``availability.py``
     
     Contains Availability & AvailField classes written to support the availability of a Room.
     Availability in this version is either Morning, Afternoon or Evening.  
     To keep the logic of this neat and efficient I've assigned the three slots equivelant binary values,
     e.g 111 = morning, afternoon & evening = 7.  From that Morning = 4, Afternoon = 2 and Evening = 1.
     This allows me throughout the software to determine very easily which of the three slots is avaiable or booked by using &
     ``booked_slots & 4`` for example would yield result of 4 if the morning was booked, 0 if not. 

- ``models.py``
     
    Contains models for VenUse including
    - User (extended to include fullname field)
    - Venue
    - Room (each Venue has many rooms)
    - Booking (each Room & User can have multiple bookings)
    - Address (each Venue can have one address)

- ``react.py``

    Contains two lists of React component names to help with dynamic rendering into html file.  
    This could be replaced in future by using something like WebPack to bundle the React App/Pages separately.

- ``urls.py``

    Contains view and api url mappings.

- ``views.py``   

    Contains all View Methods for Django rendering - setting up templates for JavaScript & React Front Ends.

### VenUse/static/VenUse/assets

This directory contains all variations of the favicon I created for this app.

### VenUse/static/VenUse/css

- ``styles.css``

    Contains main css styling for the app - as used by django html templates and regular JavaScript files.

### VenUse/static/VenUse/src/components

This directory contains all React jsx components.  These handle the **Venue** homepage and **User Bookings** rendering. Each component has it's own directory.

- ``react.css``

    Contains all css for React components.  Separated for ease of maintenance.

- ``AvailabilityCalendar/AvailabilityCalendar.jsx``

    This component renders a ``Calendar`` (using the Calendar component) and passes an ``AvailDay`` component as a child to render on each day.  This design enabled me to write a generic ``Calendar`` component that I could re-use or develop as a standalone module.

- ``AvailDay/AvailDay.jsx``

    ``AvailDay`` extracts the logic of determining the day of a given date from the ``ShowAvail`` component.

- ``AvailIcon/AvailIcon.jsx``

    A component which renders a graphical indication of the **Availability** of any given **Room** on any given day.
    Currently it renders an empty circle if there is availability.  A solid one if there is not.
    If we place ``devOnly=true`` in the URL it will render a more complex color coded icon that indicates Morning, Afternoon or Evening availability, with different colors if the slot is booked or unavailable.
    Cleary I'm not a UX designer.

- ``Booking/Booking.jsx``

    Displays a users **Booking**.  The **Venue** is rendered as a link to it's homepage.  
    Duplicates a ``showBookedSlots()`` function which renders the slots in text e.g. "Morning, Afternoon, Evening."
    This function also appears in ``utils.js`` but because of the awkward way that **React** is being implemented I was unable to import that here.

- ``Booking/Booking.test.js``

    A Jest unit test to test the component.  The test gives 100% coverage of the component, however in order for it to run the component must include ``import React from 'react';``.  Due to the way **React** is implemented in this project this breaks
    the component on running.  There are other ways to get around this, but to progress this software further I would be looking
    to use webpack to bundle **React**.  This is the only React test I wrote (I do them every day for my job now, so no need for practice)

- ``BookSlots/BookSlots.jsx``

    A modal that allows users to select which slot they which to book in a **Room** on any given date.  The checkboxes are disabled if the slot is already booked, or if the slot is unavailable.  This component calls the ``/make_booking`` **POST** endpoint. 

- ``Calendar/Calendar.jsx``

    This component renders a mobile responsive (to be fair it looks better not on mobile currently) Calendar, where each ``Day`` is a component that renders any children passed to the Calendar.  It defaults to showing todays month and highlights todays date.  It allows users to change the month forward and backwards.

- ``Calendar/Calendar.css``

    Styling specifically for this component and the ``Day`` component.  Purposely kept separate so these modules could be re-used.

- ``Day/Day.jsx``

    The ``Day`` component renders a day square (row on mobile) with the date highlighted if it is the current (active) date.  It also renders any children passed from ``Calendar``

- ``Modal/Modal.jsx``

    Wrapper component to render content in a modal.  Accepts an ``onClose()`` function and any children to render within it.

- ``MonthSelect/MonthSelect.jsx``

    Component that shifts the rendering of the Month Selector out of the ``Calendar`` component.

- ``Room/Room.jsx``

    Displays information about a **Room** on a **Venue** homepage.  Includes button to book, and pulls up to date booking data on initial rendering.

- ``ShowAvail/ShowAvail.jsx``

    Shows the availability of a **Room** on a given date.  Handles checks for clickability, renders the ``AvailIcon`` and launches the ``BookSlots`` modal when clicked.

- ``ShowRooms/ShowRooms.jsx``

    Fetches **Room** data for a given **Venue** and displays a ``Room`` component for each one.

- ``UserBookings/UserBookings.jsx``

    Retrieves **Bookings** for a given **User** and renders a ``Booking`` component for each one.

- ``Venue/Venue.jsx``

    Main component that renders information for a **Venue** on its homepage.  Renders ``VenueTitle``, ``VenueAddress`` and ``ShowRooms`` for the **Venue**

- ``VenueAddress/VenueAddress.jsx``

    Renders a **Venues** **Address**

- ``VenueTitle/VenueTitle.jsx``

    Renders a **Venues** title.

### VenUse/static/VenUse/src/javascript

This directory contains all JavaScript files.  The JavaScript files handle the Manage Venues flow of the software. 

- ``address.js``

    Handles DOM manipulation fucntions to add, save, and render an **Address**.  It uses the ``/post_address`` endpoint.

- ``availability.js``

    Functions to create an **Availability** form from an availability object, and return availability score from that form.

- ``bookings.js``

    Renders bookings for a given **Venue** using ``/get_bookings/<venue_id>`` endpoint.

- ``utils.js``

    Includes helper functions to make DOM manipulation & fetch requests less painful.

- ``venues.js``

    Main JavaScript for the Manage **Venues** flow.  Single Page Application allows adding and updating of **Rooms** and **Venues**.

### VenUse/static/VenUse/src/javascript/tests

This directory contains Jest tests for ``address.js`` and ``utils.js``
